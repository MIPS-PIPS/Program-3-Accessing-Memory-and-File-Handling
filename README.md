# CS 2640 Program 3 Accessing Memory and File Handling
Group members: Michael Wu, Brandon Tseng, Jonathan Dang

## Instructions:

### <ins>Task 1: Return a Letter Grade from Scores in Memory</ins>

Write an Assembly program that will return a letter grade for each element in an array (e.g. test scores in an array of scores). This task will have many similarities to Program 2 Task 1. Use the following scores array data in your program:

```int scores = [32, 56, 78, 66, 88, 90, 93, 100, 101, 82]```

Include the following in your program:

- a main label, a looping label, and an exit label
- a loop counter
- a separate case for grades above 100 (i.e. prints out "A with Extra Credit")
- your name printed out after all the grades are read (and before the program exits)

### <ins>Task 2: Printing Files</ins>

Write a program in Assembly that takes in a programmer-defined filename (use [practiceFile.txt](https://canvas.cpp.edu/courses/98960/files/10427759?wrap=1) provided to test). Provide a screenshot of your output for submission. Sample output is provided.

### <ins>Task 3: Append to File</ins>

Write a program in Assembly that takes practiceFile.txt file and appends to it. Provide a screenshot of your practiceFile.txt after it has been edited. Answer the following prompt with your file append: "What have you enjoyed most about the class so far?"

Bonus: file name and content is taken from user input

### <ins>Bonus Task</ins>
Write a program in Assembly that creates a file and writes to it (please use .txt files). Include the output screenshot and .txt file in your submission. 

Ideas for things to include:

- get file name and content from user input
- use macros
- have a menu
- error handling
